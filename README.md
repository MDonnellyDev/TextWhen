TextWhen
======
Basic text message scheduling application for Android.  (Name subject to change)

This is a very basic utility, with no frills--ain't nobody got time fo' dat.

This came out of a personal need:
I can schedule happy birthday texts for some date in the future.
Remind someone of something, at an appropriate time.
-("Don't forget to bring that DVD in tomorrow morning!" can be delivered "tomorrow morning")

More details to follow.  Comments, suggestions, and ideas are always welcome.


Note: I may not be held responsible if this application does not behave as expected.
I offer no guarantees of functionality or reliability.
