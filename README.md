Basic text message scheduling application for Android.  (Name subject to change)


This is my first legitimate Android application development effort (although I am not able to dedicate much time to the project).  It is intended for personal use only.

Please do not hold me responsible if you try this application and it does not function as expected.

This came out of a personal need:
I can schedule happy birthday texts for some date in the future.
I can set a reminder text for later in the day or the next morning. (a coworker: "remind me to bring that DVD in for you tomorrow morning...")


More details to follow.  Suggestions are welcome, of course.
